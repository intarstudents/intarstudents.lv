I know that [vim](http://www.vim.org/) is cool and so, but I just can't push myself to use it in daily basis, because I like [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) more. It just feels good in hands. But like all good stuff, there are some scratches when you dig dipper. Luckily, it has [easy plugin building](http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins#howto), so I was able to smooth scratches.

I guess, the most annoying thing is menu bar, because there are slim chance that you will use it daily, so why to fill unneeded space? [Toggle Menu](http://github.com/intarstudents/gEdit-Toggle-Menu) does that really easy with keyboard combo `CTRL + ALT + M`
