I did it! I packed my first [debian package](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian#dpkg.2C_installing_local_.deb_packages) and it's holding [GSDesktop Helper for Linux](http://github.com/intarstudents/GSDesktop-Helper/downloads). So for an easy installation, you can now try these commands.

```bash
cd ~
wget http://github.com/downloads/intarstudents/GSDesktop-Helper/gsd-helper-0.1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i gsd-helper-0.1_all.deb
```

And you can launch "helper" from menu (inside "Accessories") and have even more fun with it.
