At least three people asked to add _mute_ and _volume controls_ to [keySharky](http://keysharky.tldr.lv/), so I was left without other choose then to add them. Like always [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) add-on will take time to receive review before it start to automatically update itself, but you can already [install it](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/versions/?page=1#version-1.5.2). [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) and [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) should already try to update it for you.

You can download _keySharky 1.5.2_, if you don't have it already, to try it out:

* [keySharky for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/versions/?page=1#version-1.5.2)
* [keySharky for Prism](https://github.com/downloads/intarstudents/keySharky/keySharky-prism-latest.xpi)
* [keySharky for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bmdbjbgbnoljfhkjiebkdphfikhkkopn)
* [keyShakry for Safari](http://keysharky.tldr.lv/grab/keysharky.safariextz)

If you have issues, please leave them [here](https://github.com/intarstudents/keySharky/issues) and I will try to figure out whats wrong.

**Happy Holidays!**
