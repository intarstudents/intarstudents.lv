This is my latest, handy weekend project for [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com/) - [Bytingshark](https://github.com/intarstudents/Bytingshark). The main goal of it was to be able easily see playing songs mp3 file size. From that you can assume [files sound quality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3) and that just what doctor prescribed.

What you will need for this to work:

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/lv/firefox/new/)
* [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* [bytingshark.user.js](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/119253)
