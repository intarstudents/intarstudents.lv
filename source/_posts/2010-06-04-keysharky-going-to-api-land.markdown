After fun, interesting and frustrating day of development, testing and debugging, I can proudly announce [keySharky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/) **1.4b** for _Firefox_ (where **b** stands for beta). With this release I hoping to give everyone, easy access to [Grooveshark](http://preview.grooveshark.com) player, that's sitting inside [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) with little, neat [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) _hack_.

So for now, you can test it by downloading and installing this custom (with debugging enabled) [package](http://github.com/downloads/intarstudents/keySharky/keySharky-1.4b.xpi) and reading throw **API server** [wiki page](http://wiki.github.com/intarstudents/keySharky/api-server). And if you build "add-on" for _keySharky_, don't forget to tell me ;)
