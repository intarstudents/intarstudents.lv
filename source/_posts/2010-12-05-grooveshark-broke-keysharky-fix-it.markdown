With last update of Grooveshark, keySharky 1.5 is temporally broken, because new shiny HTML Grooveshark doesn't yet ship with [GroovesharkAPI](http://preview.grooveshark.com/GroovesharkAPI.html) (should be fixed in next week as I was told). 

But if you can't wait that long and still want to use Grooveshark that knows how to talk with keySharky you could upgrade to keySharky 1.5.1 for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/versions/?page=1#version-1.5.1) (not yet reviewed so no automatic update available) or/and [Prism](https://github.com/downloads/intarstudents/keySharky/keySharky-prism-latest.xpi). After upgrade go to [http://retro.grooveshark.com/](http://retro.grooveshark.com/) and you should be fine till _GroovesharkAPI_ is added to new shiny version. That's all :)
