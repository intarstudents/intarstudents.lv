When I finished [my last](http://intarstudents.lv/fun-with-4x4-led-matrix/) [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) based project, I found hard to show-off it to my friends (without using a [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/)). Even after [trying to pack it up](http://intarstudents.lv/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/01.jpg), it still was way to big for pocket and carrying around was pain in ass. So I sad to myself "Idiot, next time build something more pocket friendly and portable!". And it looks like future me was listening to that.

So what do you think? I definitely like it :) For casing I used nice and shiny (maybe not so much) _iPod_ selling case (or how it's called), that fits in pockets less or more. Shield is attached to _Arduino_ using pins found on [FDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_drive). It's powered by two 3V [CR2032](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes) batteries that are housed in holders for motherboards [BIOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS) batteries. Lastly it has _SHARLIGHT CMF-0502200 F_ seven-segment display (again, taken from old computers "[Turbo display](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button)") who is controlled by two [74HC595](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series) shift registers.

On software side, it's running reaction game where you need to press button when light comes up on display, as fast as you can. And pretty neat menu system controllable with two buttons.

I have made [set of pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/themobix/sets/72157624692941053/) on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) too :)
