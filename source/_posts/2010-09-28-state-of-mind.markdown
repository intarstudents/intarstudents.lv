Ok, time to rewind what happened. First of all, needed to move to another _VPS_ provider, because previous was so good that it just went down without a sound. Luckily had backups laying around.

Second. My previous "work machine" [Aspire One 150](http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/acer-aspire-one-windows-xp.aspx) (yes, three years I worked on that with external monitor plugged in) was slowly dying, to fix that I bought new one - [Acer eMachine E527](http://www.simplyacer.com/eMachines_E527_971094.html). And with this upgrade [Linux Mint 9](http://linuxmint.com/) is just flying! Old _Aspire One_ now has a new life with [Hackintosh](http://www.hackintosh.com/) on board, thanks to tools from [NetbookInstaller](http://code.google.com/p/netbook-installer/).

Third. [keySharky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954) is [getting support](http://github.com/intarstudents/keySharky) for [Firefox 4](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/), but it's not yet stable. Without it, I'm trying to add something new to _keySharky_, but don't know what will make into this release:

* Option to fully disable unneeded keyboard shortcuts?
* More info from gsAPI?
* Something else?
