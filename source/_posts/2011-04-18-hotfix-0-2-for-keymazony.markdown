Today I noticed that [keyMazony](https://github.com/intarstudents/keyMazony) was broken, that because [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) changed some JavaScript code inside [Cloud Player](https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/mp3/player), so rewrite for toggles was needed. Most of them I managed to save, but "Mute" functionality was missing from Cloud Player. Amazon deleted it entirely? Because of that, I removed "Mute" functionality from _keyMazony_ for now, but will see how things turn out. Grab extension for your browser [here](http://keymazony.tldr.lv/) (if it isn't already updated itself).

Goodnight!
