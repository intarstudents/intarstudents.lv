After tiny chit-chat at _#Grooveshark_ channel (in [freenode](http://freenode.net/)), it got me, [keySharky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/) 1.4 needs at least one more method in _API_ server, before shipping it - _current song status_.

Why? Because [blendalf](http://www.youtube.com/blendalf) using [Grooveshark Desktop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHwMQkpN27c) had [build cool/neat/hot looking notifier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haAWj9VmDjY) for "What song is playing in [Grooveshark](http://listen.grooveshark.com/) now?". So, no more than second later, I wanted to build something similar, but problem was that I don't use _Grooveshark Desktop_.

But luckily, _n_ minutes later, _keySharky_ had that feature on board (with [second beta version of 1.4](http://github.com/downloads/intarstudents/keySharky/keySharky-1.4b2.xpi)). Now left to do: test it for bugs and cross fingers for its approval. And of course build cool notifier :)
