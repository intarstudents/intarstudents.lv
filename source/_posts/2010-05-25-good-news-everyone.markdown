Hi, my name is **Intars** and I will take you to the journey of a lifetime. Well, maybe not, but it's pretty close. I come from unknown country inside Europe - Latvia. Stuff happening here are damn funny and interesting, but that's not what was on my mind.

I'm very geeky fella and on my free time - programmer, who likes to put his body to the limit, by writing stuff for self and open source community (yes, that's most action I ever get). But sadly it isn't inaf. and there must be way to spread the word around the glob. So here in scene comes [intarstudents.lv](http://intarstudents.lv).

I will be posting here some interesting and geeky stuff, that I have worked on, found, buried, lost, cached and loved. So buckle up, this will be geeky ride.
