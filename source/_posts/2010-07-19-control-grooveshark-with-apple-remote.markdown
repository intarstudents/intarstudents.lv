Tim Andrew has wrote neat blog post about "[How to connect Apple Remote with Grooveshark](http://blog.timothyandrew.net/post/697171692/apple-remote-with-grooveshark)". For that you will need [Remote Buddy](http://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/ajaxremote/) and [keySharky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/). It's pretty neat, I would say. Sadly, can't test it out, but go check it out :)

**P.S.** If you too have build something with _keySharky_, definitely ping me.
