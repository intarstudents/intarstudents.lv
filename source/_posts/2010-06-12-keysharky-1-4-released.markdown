Yeah, it has been done. New shiny version (with [API server](http://wiki.github.com/intarstudents/keySharky/api-server) support) of [keySharky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/) now is avaible at [Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). So grab one (or how many you like) and have fun with it.
