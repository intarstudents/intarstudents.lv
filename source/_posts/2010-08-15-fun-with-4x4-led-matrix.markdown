Well, after buying [74HC595](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut) [shift register](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register), you are left with only one option - build a [LED matrix](http://www.futurlec.com/LEDMatrix.shtml). And that's what I have done in these hot days. To spice things up I added push button with whom you can control integrated LED matrix animations (algorithms? sprites?).

What can I say - it already was blast to solder my first [stripboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripboard), but 4x4 LED grid made it even more fun and frustrating (stuffs doesn't work always :)
