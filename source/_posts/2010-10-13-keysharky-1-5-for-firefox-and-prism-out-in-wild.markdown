It's done, there is no way back. Yesterday I submitted [keySharky](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/54954/) for review in [Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), and after less then hour it was approved! _Whoot_?! That was fastest approval yet and it warmed my heart.

So why I'm telling these news to you now? Well, I could find place where put [Prism version on](http://keysharky.tldr.lv/grab/keysharky-prism-latest.xpi). But luckily my fast hands build [landing page for keySharky](http://keysharky.tldr.lv/) that's hosted on same _VPS_ as this blog and everything is back to normal.

So, you might ask what has been changed?

* New icon - bling, bling!
* Now you can disable unwanted keyboard shortcuts that _keySharky_ creates
* More methods inside [gsAPI](http://wiki.github.com/intarstudents/keySharky/api-server), so more fun
* And like always, some minor bug fixes
